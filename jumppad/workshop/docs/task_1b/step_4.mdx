# Step 4: Attach the policy to the user

```bash
vault write -n admin/<your team> auth/userpass/users/<your minecraft user>/policies policies="tavern"
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/<your minecraft user>/policies
```

Now you can open the Iron Door and retrieve Blackbeards treasure that you are going to need for the next 
task.
