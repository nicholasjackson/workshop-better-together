## Environment

Each team will be allocated a team name that will present as a child namespace in Vault and organization in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

### HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault Dedicated
For this lab, we are leveraging a single shared HCP Vault Dedicated. The parent namespace `admin` is configured with `userpass` authentication method for each team to authenticate with their respective child namespaces to read KV secrets and retreive AppRole credentials.

AAP itself will be configured to authenticate with Vault using the AppRole method directly to the child namespaces.
