# ðŸ’» Step 2: Verify your Minecraft Server

1. Use SSH from the terminal tab to connect to your Minecraft server and verify it is running:

```bash
ssh packer@$(terraform output --raw server_address)
``` 

2. Select `yes` for known host then input `packer` as password when prompted

3. Check the status of the Minecraft service:

```bash
systemctl status minecraft
```

When the service is running, you will see the following output:

```bash
Feb 15 08:28:03 ubuntu java[1092]: [08:28:03] [Server thread/INFO]: Done (16.680s)! For help, type "help"

Feb 15 08:28:03 ubuntu java[1092]: [08:28:03] [Server thread/INFO]: RCON running on 0.0.0.0:25575
````

4. Once complete, stop the logs by pressing CTRL + C.
5. Type `exit` then press enter to log out of the ubuntu server.
