# ðŸ’» Step 1: Login to HCP Vault to Configure Userpass Authentication

For this lab, the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster is accessible over the public internet. Generally, this is not recommended and should be disabled. If there is a requirement to allow public access, we recommend customers to use the IP allow list as measure to limit access and security exposure.


1. From the Instruqt lab, click on Instruqt terminal tab using the command to check Vault status: 
```bash
vault status
```
_`TEAM_NAME` has been set in the previous task. `VAULT_ADDR` is pre-set as  
```https://skoaap-public-vault-8683511a.d19fbab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200```._


_You should see the following output_:

```bash
# vault status

```

2. Login using the `userpass` method with the team's credentials by using the following command. 

```bash
vault login -ns=admin -method=userpass username="${TEAM_NAME}" password='{{ ansible_pass }}'
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
# vault login -ns=admin -method=userpass username=testorga
Password (will be hidden): 
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.
