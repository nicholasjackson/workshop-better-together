# Step 5: Find the Hidden Door
1. Inside the pirate tavern, look for a sign with a riddle.
```
Ye seek treasure? Prove ye can see,
A hidden message awaits for thee.
Look where the shadows meet,
A whisper of gold beneath your feet.
```
2. Use Minecraft mechanics (crouch/walk around) to locate a hidden sign under a table.
3. The sign reveals:
```
The door ye seek is behind the barrels!
```
4. Approach the barrels in the corner and right-click to reveal a secret passage leading to a locked iron door. 
5. Once found, you are ready to proceed to the next task to unlock the door.
