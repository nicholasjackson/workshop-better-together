# Step 2: Configure AAP Machine credentials
In this step, you will update the machine credentials in AAP to use Vault's Signed SSH credential configured in the previous step.

Machine credentials are associated with Ansible's Job templates and allow for authenticated access to a host machine and execution of a Ansible playbook.

AAP will request Vault's SSH Secrets Engine to sign the provided public key. 
The base machine for your Minecraft will be configured to trust Vault's SSH Secrets Engine public key in Task 3 using Packer and Ansible provisioner.

## Retrieve SSH keypair from Vault
You'll need to retrieve the SSH keypair from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine to configure the machine credentials in AAP, they are located in the `secrets/aap` path in Vault or use your own if you are feeling adventurous.

You can refer back to the task **Retrieve KV secrets** in **Step 1** for guidnance.

## Configure AAP Machine credentials
<Task id="configure_aap_machine_creds">
1. From the left menu, click on **Automation Execution** and then **Credentials**. The `minecraft_ssh_credentials` has been preconfigured but you'll need to input your SSK keypair.

2. Click the edit icon for **minecraft_ssh_credentials**.
![machinecredsedit](/assets/task_2/aap_machine_creds_edit.png)
3. Copy the `ssh-unsigned-private-key` you retrieved in the previous task into the **SSH Private Key** field.

4. Click the **Signed SSH Certificate** key icon to open the **Select external credential** configuration window.
    ![selectexternalcredential](/assets/task_2/aap_machine_creds_ssh.png)
    * From the *Credential* dropdown list, select **hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle**. 
    * For `Unsigned Public Key`, insert a unsigned public key. 
    * For `Path to Secret`, insert `ssh`.
    * For `Path to Auth`, insert `approle`.
    * For `Role Name`, insert `aap`.
5. Click **Test**

6. If the test is successful, click **Finish** and **Save credential** to save the configuration.

<Solution title="Solution: Retrieving SSH keypair from Vault">
The SSH keypair was generated using Terraform and stored in Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine.

1. Login to Vault if you haven't already, see step 1 for instructions.
2. Retreive the SSH private key from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, replace `<team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
 vault kv get -ns=admin/<team_name> -field=ssh-unsigned-private-key secrets/aap
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
vault kv get -ns=admin/testorga -field=ssh-unsigned-private-key secrets/aap
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
REDACTED
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```
3. Retreive the SSH public key from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, replace `<team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
 vault kv get -ns=admin/<team_name> -field=ssh-unsigned-public-key secrets/aap
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
ssh-ed25519 REDTACTED
```
