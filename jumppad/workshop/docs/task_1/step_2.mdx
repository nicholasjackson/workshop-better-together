# Step 2: Verify your Minecraft Server
1. Use SSH from the terminal tab to connect to your Minecraft server and verify it is running:

```bash
ssh packer@localhost -p2222 
``` 
2. Select Yes for known host then input `packer` as password when prompted

* Check the status of the Minecraft service:

```bash
systemctl status minecraft
```
once complete, exit the ssh session by typing `exit` and pressing enter.

*_If everything is running correctly, youâ€™re ready to set sail_!*
