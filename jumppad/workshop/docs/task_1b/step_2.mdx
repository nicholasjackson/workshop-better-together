# Step 2: Configure a user for your Minecraft User.

Each team has a unique namespace in Vault, this is rooted under the `admin` namespace.
For example if your team name is `team1`, your namespace will be `admin/team1`.

Within your namespace `userpass` authentication method is enabled. This allows you to create users and assign policies to them.
In order to open the iron door, you need to create a user for your Minecraft user and ensure that the user has the correct policy 
attached granting access to the `tavern_key` secret engine and open the iron door.

We will use the username of your Minecraft user as the userpass user and the Minecraft UUID as the password.

To retrieve this information, you can head over to the following URL: [https://mcuuid.net/](https://mcuuid.net/).

Then enter your Minecraft user and click the Lookup button, you should see something like this:

You need to copy the Full UUID value and use it as the password for the user.
export as env vars the following:
```bash
export MCUUID=<full mcuuid>
export MINECRAFT_USER=<your lowercase minecraft user>
```

Let's create a user for your Minecraft user in the `userpass' authentication method.

```bash
vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} /auth/userpass/users/${MINECRAFT_USER} password="${MCUUID}"
```

You should see some output like the following:

```bash
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/<minecraft user>
```

Now that is done, let's create a policy for the user.

<Solution title="Solution: vault cli">
check your env vars are set correctly `env`
```bash
export TEAM_NAME=<your team>
export MCUUID=<full mcuuid>
export MINECRAFT_USER=<your lowercase minecraft user>
vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} /auth/userpass/users/${MINECRAFT_USER} password="${MCUUID}"
```
</Solution>
