# 📜 Introduction
## 🌍 Forging the Path – Customizing & Deploying Your Own World

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* ✅ Build a secure Minecraft server image using Packer with Ansible provisioner, embedding Vault’s CA certificate for SSH trust.
* ✅ Deploy the new image with Terraform, integrating AAP provider to automate inventory, host registration, and user access.
* ✅ Validate that the server is running and your team is whitelisted and can connect in Minecraft.

## 📖 Scenario
The door creaks open, revealing a dark tunnel. As you step forward, the walls shimmer—a portal is forming! This is no ordinary cave; it’s a gateway to a new world. To travel through, you must forge a new Minecraft realm, customizing it with your own magical blueprints (server image) and ensuring only your trusted allies can enter.

But be warned—a broken gateway leads to nowhere. Only by carefully constructing your world with Packer and Ansible and securing its foundation with Terraform and AAP will the portal stabilize. Time is ticking—will you emerge victorious or be lost in the void?

## ⚙️ Under the Hood
Using Packer and Ansible, you'll create a new, secure Minecraft server image. Think of Packer as a blacksmith, shaping a powerful artifact with Ansible spells to install and configure the server. You’ll also ensure the server trusts Vault’s CA certificate, allowing secure access using signed SSH keys.

Once the image is forged, Terraform acts as the ancient architect, deploying your new world. The Terraform AAP provider will integrate with Ansible Automation Platform, ensuring only the chosen adventurers gain access. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional, securely managed Minecraft server—ready for the ultimate challenge ahead!

#### 1. Build a New Secure Minecraft Image with Packer
* Packer + Ansible installs and configures Minecraft.
* Ansible adds Vault’s CA certificate to enable future signed SSH.


#### 2. Deploy Updated Terraform 
* Terraform updates to use the new image.
* Terraform triggers Ansible (AAP provider) to whitelist your Minecraft usernames for server access.
