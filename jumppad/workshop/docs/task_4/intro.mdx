## 📖 Scenario
You have braved the Tavern’s locked door, crafted a secure Minecraft world, and configured access using AAP. Now you stand on the edge of the final frontier. Blackbeard’s ultimate treasure lies scattered across the seas—hidden behind mysterious riddles and technical challenges.

To claim the prize, you must:

1. Gain entry to the Final Challenge server (using the credentials and knowledge from previous tasks).
2. Conquer an array of puzzles—each revealing coordinates of buried treasure in Minecraft’s survival mode.
3. Accumulate gold coins from discovered treasures, outshining rival pirate crews!

## ⚙️ Under the Hood
 Behind the pirate aesthetic, you’ll be:

1. Reinforcing your knowledge of HashiCorp tools by deciphering new puzzles (Terraform commands, Vault secrets, Packer references, Ansible configs).
2. Cross-referencing solutions with Minecraft to locate hidden treasures—mirroring real-world DevOps pipelines that connect multiple systems.
3. Competing for the highest score (most gold coins), which drives real-time learning, problem-solving, and teamwork.

Technical Ties:

1. Terraform: The server infrastructure for the final challenge, including dynamic logs or outputs that hint at puzzle solutions.
2. Vault: Additional secrets or passphrases stored under unique paths to be retrieved and used for puzzle completion.
3. Packer: The final server image references or keys hidden within advanced provisioning tasks.
4. Ansible: Puzzle scripts, whitelists, or automation steps controlling who can claim each hidden loot chest.
