# Step 1: Retreive AppRole credentials and configure AAP
In this step, you will retreive the AppRole credentials and configure AAP to use Vault's SSH key signing for Ansible's job execution.

The AppRole auth method has been preconfigured for each team in their respective namespaces, as such the Role ID and Secret ID are unique to each team and are stored in Vault. This task will guide you through retrieving the Role ID and Secret ID for use with AAP. 

With the door now open, you step inside the dimly lit chamber. The air is thick with mystery, and on the far wall, a mechanical lockbox gleams under the flickering lantern light. Inscribed on its surface are strange markingsâ€”an ancient security mechanism known as AppRole Authentication. To proceed, you must extract the Role ID and Secret ID from Vault, using them to power up the automation magic of AAP.

## 1. Retreive AppRole credentials

1. Using the same terminal that you logged into Vault with in the prior tasks, retreive the Role ID using the command, replace `<team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault read -ns=admin/<team_name> auth/approle/role/aap/role-id
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault read -ns=admin/testorga auth/approle/role/aap/role-id
Key        Value
---        -----
role_id    3d05b15f-4262-419a-c609-b3a2633877b4
```
2. Retreive the Secret ID using the command, replace `<team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault write -ns=admin/<team_name> -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault write -ns=admin/testorga -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
Key                   Value
---                   -----
secret_id             950d8a35-5b34-228f-5475-030c6ecbf970
secret_id_accessor    7978c558-2d0c-5ab9-c178-89ee68bab69c
secret_id_num_uses    0
secret_id_ttl         0s
```
3. Copy the `role_id` and `secret_id` as you will need them in the next task.

```bash
export TEAM_NAME='<your team>'
vault read -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} auth/approle/role/aap/role-id
vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
```
</Solution>

## 2. Configure AAP Vault SSH credentials

1. From the Instruqt lab, click on the **Ansible Automation Platform** tab to open the AAP interface. (ignore any certificate warnings, this is lab environment)
2. Enter the username allocated to your team and the password (stored in Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine, the path is `secrets/app`. You can refer back to the task **Retrieve KV secrets** in **Step 1** for guidnance.).
```bash
AAP_Username:`<team_name>_admin`  
AAP_Password:`{{ ansible_pass }}`
```

3. From the left menu, click on **Automation Execution** and then **Credentials**. The `hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle` has been preconfigured but you'll need to input the AppRole Role ID and Secret ID to complete the configuration.

4. Edit the credentials for the **hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle** credential.
5. Enter the Role ID and Secret ID you retrieved in the previous task into the respective fields.

8. Click **Save credential** to save the configuration.
