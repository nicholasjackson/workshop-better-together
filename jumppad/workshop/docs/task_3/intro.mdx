# Task 3 Use Packer to Build a Custom Minecraft Server Image

* Part 1: Create a new Packer configuration that builds a new Minecraft server image.
* Part 2: Build the image with Packer
Can these be moved to task 4?
* Part 3: Update your Terraform configuration to use the new image.
* Part 4: Complete the task in Minecraft ...

Does this need to be a mindcraft server? its not clear what the purpose is here
other simple options that could would be quick to implement and allow tie in to final 
- depoy docker to packer image using ansible provisioner, just install docker using ansible thats it.

## We can provide playbook for provisioner
---
- name: "Install Docker packages"
  apt:
    name:
      - docker-ce
      - docker-ce-cli
      - containerd.io
      - docker-compose-plugin
    update_cache: yes 

- name: "Docker Service"
  systemd:
    name: docker.service
    enabled: yes
    state: started

- name: Add user 'ubuntu' to the 'docker' group
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: ubuntu
    groups: docker
    append: yes
  become: true

 ## And provider provisioner block to populate the pkr file

- In task 4 we then deploy and run a startup a basic API server docker image that returns a simple message to unlock the final task in game.
If we are using this deployment for task 4 and executing an ansible job on the server we need to be able to return a public IP addresss from the terraform as a resource attribute.
