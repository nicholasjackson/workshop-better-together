# Step 1: Login to HCP Vault to confgure userpass authentication

To access the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster you can use the following FQDN:
```
https://skoaap-public-vault-8683511a.d19fbab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200
```

For this lab, the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster is accessible over the public internet. Generally, this is not recommended and should be disabled. 
If there is a requirement to allow public access, we recommend customers to use the IP allow list as measure to limit access and security exposure.
