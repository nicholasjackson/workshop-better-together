# üíª Step 2: Configure AAP Machine Credentials
In this step, you will update the machine credentials in AAP to use the Vault Signed SSH credential plugin configured in the previous step.

Machine credentials are linked to Ansible Job Templates, enabling authenticated access to the target machine for playbook execution.

When a job runs, AAP requests Vault‚Äôs SSH Secrets Engine to sign the provided public key. The base Minecraft server is already configured to trust Vault‚Äôs SSH public key (this was set up in Task 3 using Packer and Ansible).

## 1. Retrieve SSH keypair from Vault
Retrieve the SSH keypair from Vault‚Äôs KVv2 Secrets Engine at the path `secrets/aap` to configure the machine credentials in AAP. Alternatively, you may use your own keypair if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous.
Refer to the previous step for guidance on accessing Vault.

<Solution title="Solution">
The SSH keypair was generated using Terraform and stored in Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine.

1. Login to Vault if you haven't already, see step 1 for instructions.
2. Retreive the SSH private key from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, 
env var for `TEAM_NAME` should already be set with your team's name.
```bash
 vault kv get -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} -field=ssh-unsigned-private-key secrets/aap
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
vault kv get -ns=admin/testorga -field=ssh-unsigned-private-key secrets/aap
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
REDACTED
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```
3. Retreive the SSH public key from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, 
env var for `TEAM_NAME` should already be set with your team's name.
```bash
 vault kv get -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} -field=ssh-unsigned-public-key secrets/aap
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
ssh-ed25519 REDTACTED
```

## 2. Configure AAP Machine credentials

1. From the left menu, click **Automation Execution** -> **Infrastructure** -> **Credentials**. Locate `minecraft_ssh_credentials`, which has been preconfigured, but you will need to enter your SSH keypair to complete the setup.

2. Click the edit icon for **minecraft_ssh_credentials**.

3. Copy the `ssh-unsigned-private-key` retrieved in the previous task into the **SSH Private Key** field.

4. Click the **Signed SSH Certificate** key icon to open the **Select external credential** configuration window.

    * From the **Credential** dropdown list, select **hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle**, fill out the following fields:
        - **Unsigned Public Key**: copy paste the `unsigned public key` from the last step
        - **Path to Secret**: `ssh`
        - **Path to Auth**: `approle`
        - **Role Name**: `aap`
5. Click **Test**

6. If the test is successful, click **Finish** and **Save credential** to save the configuration.

```
See TA if your stuck and need help.
You will be unable to complete the next task without the machine credentials.
