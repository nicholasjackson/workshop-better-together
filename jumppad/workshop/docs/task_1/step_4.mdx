# Step 4: Locate the Tavern
1. Blackbeard hid the tavern well, but he left behind a cryptic clue:

```
Where the sun meets the shore and shadows grow tall,
A place where the lost come to drink and recall.
To find your way, seek through the glass,
Where lanterns flicker, and echoes of past.
```

2. Enter the Minecraft world and explore your surroundings.
3. Equip your spyglass (provided in your inventory).
4. Scan the horizon for a tavern-like structure with flickering lanterns.

## Did I get it right?
_todo: need to add validation of tavern coordinate (x,y,z)_
