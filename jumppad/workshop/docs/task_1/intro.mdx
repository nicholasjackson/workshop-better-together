## 📖 Scenario:

You and your crew aboard The HashiCorsair are on a daring quest for Blackbeard’s Hidden Treasure. To begin your journey, you must establish a hidden pirate island by provisioning your environment using Terraform.

Once the island is set up, your first challenge is to locate the legendary Tavern of the Lost Buccaneers, where Blackbeard’s secret map is rumored to be hidden. But beware—he didn’t make it easy. The tavern’s location is encrypted within an ancient pirate riddle, and only those with keen eyes and sharp wits can uncover it.

## ⚙️ Under the Hood

As you step into Blackbeard’s Tavern, you're not just solving riddles—you’re uncovering the secrets of Vault authentication and access control. The locked door isn’t just a physical barrier; it represents secure access management, where only those with the right credentials can enter.

Before you can start your search, you must prove your identity. By using the userpass authentication method, Vault verifies who you are and grants access to your team’s namespace.

Vault is a secure treasure chest for sensitive data. The riddle on the tavern wall is your puzzle to solve, guiding you to the right Vault path where the key (secret) is stored. Once you retrieve it, you’ll use the hidden phrase to unlock the door in Minecraft—just like an API call checking for the right credentials.

Once inside, you’ll find a chest with a book containing critical information for your next adventure. This mirrors secure secrets retrieval in Vault, where only authorized users can access confidential data.
