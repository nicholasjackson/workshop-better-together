# üíª Step 1: Build New Secure Packer Image with Ansible

In this step, you will build a secure Packer image configured with the Ansible provisioner. This image will serve as the foundation for creating a new Minecraft server. An Ansible playbook is executed during the image build process, as shown in the preconfigured code block in the Packer HCL template.

```hcl
   provisioner "ansible" {
    playbook_file = "${path.cwd}/ansible/playbook.yml"
    user          = "packer"

    ansible_env_vars = [
      "ANSIBLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=False",
      "ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False",
      "ANSIBLE_NOCOLOR=True",
      "ANSIBLE_NOCOWS=1",
      "VAULT_NAMESPACE=${var.vault_namespace}",
      "VAULT_URL=${var.vault_url}",
      "ANSIBLE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=/usr/bin/python3",
      "ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TEMP=/tmp/ansible"
    ]

    extra_arguments = [
      "--ssh-extra-args",
      "-o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes",
      "--scp-extra-args",
      "'-O'"
    ]
  }
```

The Ansible playbook executed during the Packer image build will:
- Install and configure the Minecraft server
- Configure sshd to trust Vault‚Äôs public key for your namespace, enabling secure signed SSH access.
Example structure from the playbook:
```yaml
- name: Minecraft Install with Vault SSH prereqs
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: "Include minecraft tasks"
      include_tasks: minecraft.yml

    - name: "Include vault tasks"
      include_tasks: vault_ssh.yml
```
You can explore the playbook and task files by navigating to the **workshop** tab ‚Üí **packer/ansible** directory in your environment.

# Build New Secure Packer Image

1. Switch to the `packer` directory and open the integrated terminal tab: 
```bash
cd packer
```
2. Validate packer configuration:
```bash
packer init .
packer validate .
```
_You will likely see the following output:_:
```
root@debian:/workshop/src/working/task3_a_packer# packer validate .
Error: Unset variable "vault_namespace"

A used variable must be set or have a default value; see
https://packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/syntax for details.
```
This error is expected!
It indicates that the required `vault_namespace` variable is not set.

Before moving forward, take a moment to think through how you might fix this based on your past work with Terraform variables and environment setup.
When ready, set the vault_namespace variable with your team‚Äôs namespace before validating.

## üîç Did You Get It Right?

<Task id="packer_build">
## Populate the required variables
*Hint: **vault_namespace** is your team name*
env var: `TEAM_NAME` should already be set to your team name, check `env`
```bash
packer build -var vault_namespace="${TEAM_NAME}" .
```
</Task>
<Solution title="Solution">
check your env vars are set correctly `env`
```bash
echo $TEAM_NAME
cd /workshop/src/working/packer
packer init .
packer build -var vault_namespace="${TEAM_NAME}"
```
