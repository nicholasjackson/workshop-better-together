# ðŸ’» Step 2: Verify your Minecraft Server

1. Use SSH from the terminal tab to connect to your Minecraft server and verify it is running:

```bash
ssh packer@$(terraform output --raw server_address)
``` 

2. Select `yes` for known host then input `packer` as password when prompted

3. Check the status of the Minecraft service:

```bash
systemctl status minecraft
```

When the service is running, you will see the following output:

```bash

````

4. Once complete, exit the ssh session by typing `exit` and pressing enter.
