# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Step 2: The Puzzle Gauntlet ‚Äì Claiming Blackbeard‚Äôs Treasure

## Scenario
Having gained entry to the shared GCP Minecraft server, you now stand on the threshold of Blackbeard‚Äôs final domain‚Äîa sprawling survival world filled with hidden puzzles and buried treasure. Each puzzle solved reveals coordinates for a chest containing precious loot. The rarer the item, the more gold coins it‚Äôs worth.

## Objectives

* ‚úÖ Complete as many puzzles as possible within the time limit.
* ‚úÖ Locate the corresponding treasure chests in Minecraft using the revealed coordinates.
* ‚úÖ Accumulate the highest total of gold coins from the loot.

## Puzzle Format & Difficulty Levels
- Easy (15 puzzles)
    - Short questions or riddles, often referencing basics of Terraform, Vault KV secrets, or simple Packer config.
    - Rewards: Low-value items (e.g., compasses = 5 gold coins).
- Intermediate (15 puzzles)
    - More in-depth tasks, like retrieving secrets using Vault AppRole or referencing advanced Ansible playbook steps.
    - Rewards: Medium-value items (e.g., iron ingots = 10 gold coins).
- Difficult (15 puzzles)
    - Complex, scenario-based challenges (e.g., multi-cloud Terraform, advanced Packer provisioners, layered Vault PKI usage, or tricky Ansible roles).
    - Rewards: High-value items (e.g., gold ingots = 20 coins, diamonds = 25 coins).

## How to Engage the Puzzles

1. Log in to the Minecraft Server that you discovered from Blackbeard's last clue.

* If you solved the previous task, you should have access to the Minecraft server.
* If you are getting a message that you are not whitelisted, please speak with your TA for help 
as there may have been a problem with the previous task.

2. Solve the Puzzle

* Puzzles are grouped into easy, intermediate, and difficult categories.
* Each puzzle involves an aspect of Terraform, Vault, Packer, or Ansible‚Äîbased on everything you‚Äôve learned.
* The correct solution reveals a set of coordinates for a hidden chest.

3. Ask Pirate HashiCorp_Nic for a hint or if your answer is correct.

* You can interact with `HashiCorp_Nic` in the same way that you did previously using the `/tell` command.
* If you need help with a puzzle, you can ask for a hint, for example just type `/tell HashiCorp_Nic can I have a hint for puzzle 1 please?`.
* If you know the answer then ask if it is correct, for example `/tell HashiCorp_Nic is the answer to puzzle 1 terraform apply`.
  If you are correct, you will receive the coordinates for the chest.

3. Hunt for the Treasure

* Head to those coordinates.
* Dig or explore until you find the chest.
* Claim the loot inside, which has a certain gold coin value.
4. Record Your Spoils

* Keep track of your items (in your inventory or chest near spawn).
* At the end of the challenge, TAs will count your coin total.

## Time & Strategy
* You have 45 minutes to solve as many puzzles as possible.
* Choose wisely: Sometimes tackling a high-difficulty puzzle can net bigger rewards, but it also takes longer to solve.

## Scoring & Win Conditions
1. Item Values

* Compass = 5 coins
* Iron Ingot = 10 coins
* Gold Ingot = 20 coins
* Diamond = 25 coins

2. Turn-In Process

* When time ends, gather at spawn.
* TAs will record score for your team.

3. Final Winner

The pirate with the highest gold coin total claims Blackbeard‚Äôs ultimate treasure and eternal bragging rights!
