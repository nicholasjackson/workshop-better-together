* ✅ Explore the synergy of HashiCorp tools and Ansible—from code to final deployment.

## 🏴‍☠️ Pirate-Themed Story

Ahoy, adventurers! In this workshop, you’ll embark on a pirate-style treasure hunt across multiple tasks. Each task unlocks new secrets and deeper technical concepts:

Terraform sets sail by provisioning the environment.
Vault hides and reveals hidden secrets behind locked doors.
Packer forges new worlds (images).
Ansible orchestrates tasks to claim your loot!



## ⚙️ Under the Hood 

1. Terraform: Provisions cloud resources and servers (the “islands” and “ships”).
2. Vault: Stores and secures credentials (“treasure keys”), controlling who can open locked chests.
3. Packer: Builds server images with preconfigured software—like forging a sturdy pirate ship.
4. Ansible: Automates configuration, user access, and final touches—your crew doing the daily tasks.

Together, these tools form a powerful DevOps pipeline, enabling you to plan, secure, build, and automate environments quickly and consistently.

## 🏗️ Structure of the Lab
1. Task 1a + 1b: Deploy Minecraft with Terraform and Configure Vault to Access the first clue of Blackbeards treasure.
2. Task 2: HCP Vault with AAP – Configure AAP machine credentials to enable AAP to access Vault.
3. Task 3: Terraform + Packer + Ansible – Build a custom image and configure an AAP job to configure the new server and access the second clue.
4. Final Challenge: A puzzle gauntlet requiring all four skills to claim the legendary pirate treasure.

Each task immerses you in a hands-on storyline, where you’ll apply new knowledge to open doors, uncover secrets, and build worlds—all while learning best practices in a gamified setting.

## 🔭 Preview: The Final Challenge
After mastering the fundamentals, you’ll face a final puzzle-based treasure hunt:

1. Solve short riddles or hands-on tasks that revisit Terraform, Vault, Packer, and Ansible concepts.

2. Each puzzle reveals coordinates (or a clue) leading to hidden chests in Minecraft’s survival mode.

3. Collect items of varying worth, accumulating gold coin totals in a friendly competition.

### Will you and your crew emerge as the rightful pirate lords? Only your teamwork, cunning, and technical prowess can decide!
