# Step 4: Use the Spyglass to Locate the Tavern
* Blackbeard hid the tavern well, but he left behind a cryptic clue:

```
Where the sun meets the shore and shadows grow tall,
A place where the lost come to drink and recall.
To find your way, seek through the glass,
Where lanterns flicker, and echoes of past.
```

* Enter the Minecraft world and explore your surroundings.
* Equip your spyglass (provided in your inventory).
* Scan the horizon for a tavern-like structure with flickering lanterns.
* Once found, make your way to the tavern entrance to complete the task.
