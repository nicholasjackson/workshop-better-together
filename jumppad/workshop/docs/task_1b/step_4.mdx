```bash
vault write -ns admin/${TEAM_NAME} auth/userpass/users/${MINECRAFT_USER}/policies token_policies="tavern"
```

You should see the following output:

Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/<your minecraft user>/policies
```

Now you can open the Iron Door and retrieve Blackbeards treasure that you are going to need for the next 
task.
