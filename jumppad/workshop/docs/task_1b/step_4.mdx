# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Step 4: Open the Iron Door

1. Back in Minecraft you should now be able to open the iron door. But first you need
to obtain a keycard containing a Vault token that has the correct policy attached. You can do this by right clicking on the blue card vending machine.

The vending machine attempts to log into Vault using the userpass method using your
Minecraft account `name` and the `uuid` for the account. This is the same account you
configured in the previous step. If the login is successful, it will return a keycard.

2. Once you have the keycard, hold the keycard in your hand and right click on the lock
next to the vending machine. The door should now open.
