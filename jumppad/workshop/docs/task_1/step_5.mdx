2. Use Minecraft mechanics (crouch/walk around) to locate a hidden sign under a table.
3. The sign reveals:
```
The door ye seek is behind the barrels!
```
4. Approach the barrels in the corner and right-click to reveal a secret passage leading to a locked iron door. 
5. Once found, you are ready to proceed to the next task to unlock the door.
