# Step 1: Login to HCP Vault and retrieve secrets
## HCP Vault Address
To access the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster you can use the following FQDN:
```
https://skoaap-public-vault-8683511a.d19fbab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200
```
For this lab, the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster is accessible over the public internet. Generally, this is not recommended and should be disabled. 
If there is a requirement to allow public access, we recommend customers to use the IP allow list as measure to limit access and security exposure. 
More information can be found in the <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/manage-public-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage public network access</a>

## Login to HCP Vault
<Task id="vault_login">
1. From the Instruqt lab, click on Instruqt terminal tab to begin.
2. The <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault CLI</a> is pre-installed in the terminal. However, you'll need to set the environment variable `VAULT_ADDR` to the HCP Vault address. Set the environment variable in the terminal using:
```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=https://skoaap-public-vault-8683511a.d19fbab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200
```
4. Check Vault status using the command:
```bash
vault status
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault status

5. Login using the `userpass` method with the team's credentials by using the command, replace `<your_team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault login -namespace=admin -method=userpass username='<your_team_name>' password='{{ ansible_pass }}'
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault login -namespace=admin -method=userpass username=testorga
Password (will be hidden): 
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

## Retrieve KV secrets
<Task id="read_kv_secrets">
1. Using the same terminal that you logged into Vault with, retreive a secret from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, replace `<your_team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault kv get -namespace=admin/<your_team_name>; secrets/skofy26
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault kv get -namespace=admin/testorga secrets/skofy26
