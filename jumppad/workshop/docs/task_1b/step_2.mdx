# 💻 Step 2: Create a Vault Policy to Allow Access to the Tavern_key

Each team has a unique namespace in Vault, structured under the `admin` namespace.
For example, if your team name is `team1`, your namespace will be `admin/team1`.

Within your namespace, the `userpass` authentication method is enabled, allowing you to create users and assign policies.

To unlock the iron door in Minecraft, you’ll need to create a Vault user for your Minecraft username and attach a policy that grants access to the `tavern_key` secret in Vault. This will allow you to retrieve the key and open the door.



1. Create a policy in your team’s namespace that grants access to the `tavern_key` secret in the KVv2 secrets engine using the command below:

```bash
vault policy write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} tavern - <<EOF
path "secrets/data/tavern_key" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
Success! Uploaded policy: tavern
```

**Now that the policy is created, let's create a user and assign them this policy.**
