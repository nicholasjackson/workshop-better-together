# Part 1: HCP Vault login and retrieving secrets

Each

## HCP Vault Address
To access the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster you can use the following FQDN.

```
https://skoaap-public-vault-7a278d60.8c03478c.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200/
```

For this lab,  the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster is accessible over the public internet. Generally, this is not recommended and should be disabled. If there is a requirement to allow public access, we recommend customers to use the IP allow list as measure to limit access and security exposure. More information can be found in the [Manage public network access
](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/manage-public-access).

## Login to HCP Vault

1. Click on Instrqut terminal tab to begin.
2. The [Vault CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands) is pre-installed in the terminal. However, you'll need to set the environment variable `VAULT_ADDR` to the HCP Vault address as by default its `https://127.0.0.1:8200`.
3. Set the environment variable in the terminal using
```
export VAULT_ADDR=https://skoaap-public-vault-7a278d60.8c03478c.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200/
```
4. Check Vault status using the command
```
vault status
```
You should see the following output
```
