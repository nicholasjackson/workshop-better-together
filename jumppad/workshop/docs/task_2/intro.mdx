# Introduction

## 🚪 The Locked Door – Vault Secrets & Hidden Clues

## 🧭 Learning Objectives:
By completing this task, you will:

* ✅ Authenticate with HashiCorp Vault to retrieve secrets.
* ✅ Use Vault-signed SSH credentials to configure access.
* ✅ Solve in-game puzzles to unlock the hidden door inside the tavern.
* ✅ Locate and open the treasure chest to retrieve the book of secrets for Task 3.

## 📖 Scenario:

You’ve arrived at Blackbeard’s Tavern, a mysterious hideout filled with secrets. Rumors speak of a locked door hiding a legendary treasure chest. To enter, you must solve a riddle to reveal the access policy stored in Vault. Once inside, another puzzle awaits, guiding you to a hidden book that holds the key to your next adventure.

Will you crack the secrets and claim the prize, or will you be lost in the depths of the tavern forever? 🏴‍☠️💀

## Under the Hood 

1. Configure Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Hashicorp Vault Signed SSH credentials plugin to authenticate with Hashicorp Vault
2. Configure machine credentials for Ansible Job Templates to authenticate with remote hosts using Vault signed SSH credentials
3. Each team will be allocated a team name that will present as a child namespace in Vault and organization in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).
4. For this lab, we are leveraging a single shared HCP Vault Dedicated. The parent namespace `admin` is configured with `userpass` authentication method for each team to authenticate with their respective child namespaces to read KV secrets and retreive AppRole credentials.
5. AAP itself will be configured to authenticate with Vault using the AppRole method directly to the child namespaces.
