# 📜 Introduction
## 🌍 Forging the Path – Customizing & Deploying Your Own World

## 🧭 Learning Objectives

* ✅ Build a custom Minecraft server image using Packer & Ansible.
* ✅ Configure Vault trust for secure authentication.
* ✅ Deploy the new server image using Terraform & AAP integration.
* ✅ Dynamically update the server access list via AAP provider.

## 📖 Scenario
The door creaks open, revealing a dark tunnel. As you step forward, the walls shimmer—a portal is forming! This is no ordinary cave; it’s a gateway to a new world. To travel through, you must forge a new Minecraft realm, customizing it with your own magical blueprints (server image) and ensuring only your trusted allies can enter.

But be warned—a broken gateway leads to nowhere. Only by carefully constructing your world with Packer and Ansible and securing its foundation with Terraform and AAP will the portal stabilize. Time is ticking—will you emerge victorious or be lost in the void?

## ⚙️ Under the Hood
Using Packer and Ansible, you'll create a new, secure Minecraft server image. Think of Packer as a blacksmith, shaping a powerful artifact with Ansible spells to install and configure the server. You’ll also ensure the server trusts Vault’s CA certificate, allowing secure access using signed SSH keys.

Once the image is forged, Terraform acts as the ancient architect, deploying your new world. The Terraform AAP provider will integrate with Ansible Automation Platform, ensuring only the chosen adventurers gain access. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional, securely managed Minecraft server—ready for the ultimate challenge ahead!

#### Build a new secure Minecraft image with Packer
* Install and configure Minecraft server using the packer Ansible provisioner
* Use Ansible in Packer to trust the Vault namespace CA certificate for AAP to connect to remote hosts using signed SSH

#### Deploy updated terraform 
* Update your existing Terraform configuration to use the new image and configure the AAP provider to integrate with Ansible to update the Minecraft access list 
* deploy and using updated Terraform that executes post install acccess list via Ansible Automaiton Platform using the AAP provider
