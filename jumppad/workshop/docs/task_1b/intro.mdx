# Introduction

## 🔐 Configure Vault to Access the Treasure

## 🧭 Learning Objectives:
By completing this task, you will:

* ✅ Log in to HCP Vault using userpass authentication.
* ✅ Create a new user and assign a Vault policy.
* ✅ Grant your Minecraft user access to the tavern_key secret (needed to open the iron door).
* ✅ Practice secure secrets management in a real-world scenario.


## 📖 Scenario:

You’ve navigated the dark halls of Blackbeard’s domain, only to face yet another locked barrier—an iron door rumored to guard a vital treasure. To unlock it, you must enlist the help of Vault. First, you log in to the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster. Then, you create a user for your Minecraft character, forging the credentials needed to authenticate and access the hidden path. Finally, by crafting and binding a Vault policy to this user, you’ll gain the precise permission to retrieve the tavern_key secret and swing the door wide open.

Will you triumph over Vault’s guardianship and claim the secret that awaits beyond?

## Under the Hood

1. You set up a user account (matching your Minecraft handle) that authenticates via simple username/password.
2. Each team has its own sub-namespace (e.g., admin/team1) to prevent interference and allow unique configurations.
Vault Policies: By writing a policy (tavern), you control who can read what secret (the tavern_key path).
3. Attaching the policy to the new user ensures only that user can fetch the door’s secret.
Armed with these steps, you’ll soon open the iron door and claim Blackbeard’s missing piece of the treasure puzzle!
