# Step 4: Use the Spyglass to Locate the Tavern
1. Blackbeard hid the tavern well, but he left behind a cryptic clue:

```
🏴‍☠️ Ye Olde Pirates' Map 🏴‍☠️
               ================================
                    
         /\___/\  Where the sun meets the shore
        (  o_o  )    and shadows grow tall,
         (  T  )  A place where the lost
        ,-."-"-.      come to drink and recall.
       /  |   |  \
      /   |   |   \  To find your way, 
                      seek through the glass,
          |   |    Where lanterns flicker,
          |___|      and echoes of past.
          
               ================================
                    X marks the spot, matey!
```

2. Enter the Minecraft world and explore your surroundings.
3. Equip your **spyglass** (provided in your inventory).
4. Scan the horizon for a **tavern-like structure** with <FlickeringLantern />🏮**flickering lanterns**🏮<FlickeringLantern />.
5. Once found, make your way to the tavern entrance to complete the task.
