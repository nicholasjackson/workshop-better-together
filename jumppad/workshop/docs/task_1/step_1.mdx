# üíª Step 1: Initialize the Environment:
 1. Open the Instruqt terminal and navigate to the Terraform project directory.

 2. You need to set a couple of environment variables to configure the server. 
 To do this you will need your team name, replace `<team_name>` with your team 
 name and run the following commands:

 ```bash
export TEAM_NAME=<team_name>
export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin/$TEAM_NAME
export TF_VAR_VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin/$TEAM_NAME
 ```

 3. Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

 ```
cd terraform
terraform init
```
*_This downloads the necessary Libvirt provider plugins required to create the virtual machine_.*

4. Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the Minecraft server:

```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
*_Terraform will provision a virtual machine that acts as your pirate world_.*

5. Once complete, Terraform will output the server‚Äôs IP address.
