## 🏴‍☠️ Pirate-Themed Story

Ahoy, adventurers! In this workshop, you’ll embark on a pirate-style treasure hunt across multiple tasks. Each task unlocks new secrets and deeper technical concepts:

Terraform sets sail by provisioning the environment.
Vault hides and reveals hidden secrets behind locked doors.
Packer forges new worlds (images).
Ansible orchestrates tasks to claim your loot!



## ⚙️ Under the Hood 

1. Terraform: Provisions cloud resources and servers (the “islands” and “ships”).
2. Vault: Stores and secures credentials (“treasure keys”), controlling who can open locked chests.
3. Packer: Builds server images with preconfigured software—like forging a sturdy pirate ship.
4. Ansible: Automates configuration, user access, and final touches—your crew doing the daily tasks.

Together, these tools form a powerful DevOps pipeline, enabling you to plan, secure, build, and automate environments quickly and consistently.

## 🏗️ Structure of the Lab
1. Task 1a + 1b: Deploy Minecraft with Terraform and Configure Vault to Access the Treature.
2. Task 2: HCP Vault with AAP – Retrieve secrets to unlock hidden tavern doors.
3. Task 3: Packer + Ansible – Build a custom image and manage server access.
4. Final Challenge: A puzzle gauntlet requiring all four skills to claim the legendary pirate treasure.

Each task immerses you in a hands-on storyline, where you’ll apply new knowledge to open doors, uncover secrets, and build worlds—all while learning best practices in a gamified setting.

## 🔭 Preview: The Final Challenge
After mastering the fundamentals, you’ll face a final puzzle-based treasure hunt:

Solve short riddles or hands-on tasks that revisit Terraform, Vault, Packer, and Ansible concepts.

Each puzzle reveals coordinates (or a clue) leading to hidden chests in Minecraft’s survival mode.

Collect items of varying worth, accumulating gold coin totals in a friendly competition.

Will you and your crew emerge as the rightful pirate lords? Only your teamwork, cunning, and technical prowess can decide!
