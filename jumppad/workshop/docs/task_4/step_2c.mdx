# Difficult Puzzles
### 1. Terraform Dynamic Blocks
**Puzzle**: “Beyond a static plan lies an ever-shifting sea of resources. Which Terraform feature weaves new blocks on the fly?”  
**Hint**: Generates nested or repeated blocks programmatically within `.tf` files.

---

### 2. Terraform Cloud-Init or local-exec Provisioners
**Puzzle**: “When standard resource definitions fail ye, how do you run a special script or command at creation time?”  
**Hint**: A fallback for tasks outside direct Terraform resource declarations.

---

### 3. Terraform Taint
**Puzzle**: “To rebuild a single resource as if cursed, how do ye mark it for re-creation without scuttling the entire fleet?”  
**Hint**: A command that forces Terraform to destroy and recreate a resource on the next apply.

---

### 4. Terraform State Import
**Puzzle**: “When existing treasure was discovered outside your plan, how do you track it under Terraform’s watchful log?”  
**Hint**: A process or command that brings external resources under Terraform control.

---

### 5. Vault OIDC Auth
**Puzzle**: “To unify logins for your crew across identity providers, which Vault method sets a common sign-on standard?”  
**Hint**: Federates users via OpenID Connect.

---

### 6. Vault Replication (Performance/DR)
**Puzzle**: “Ye want multiple strongholds for secrets—how does Vault replicate across distant seas for High Availability?”  
**Hint**: A mode that syncs data between primary and secondary Vault clusters.

---

### 7. Vault Database Secrets Engine
**Puzzle**: “When a DB user must be conjured for a single query, which arcane engine spawns ephemeral credentials?”  
**Hint**: Provides dynamic, time-limited database accounts.

---

### 8. Packer Multi-Builder
**Puzzle**: “To cast many images in one pass—AWS, Azure, VMware— which Packer feature spawns multiple ship designs from a single blueprint?”  
**Hint**: A single template that includes multiple builder sections.

---

### 9. Packer Post-Processor: Manifest
**Puzzle**: “Once your images are forged, you keep track of them in a ledger. Which Packer stage writes that final register?”  
**Hint**: A step that documents or indexes build artifacts.

---

### 10. Packer HCL2
**Puzzle**: “JSON was once the script, but thou hast discovered a better language for your template. What’s the new format?”  
**Hint**: The same config style that Terraform v0.12+ uses—makes Packer more flexible.

---

### 11. Ansible Pull for Immutable Deployments
**Puzzle**: “A build triggers an ephemeral server to fetch tasks from a code repo— how do you spin these tasks locally instead of a top-down push?”  
**Hint**: The lesser-used Ansible approach that inverts the control flow.

---

### 12. Ansible Vault with CI/CD
**Puzzle**: “Lock your secrets in a pipeline where code merges daily— which advanced approach ensures your keys remain safe but still accessible to the pipeline?”  
**Hint**: Involves storing `vault_password_file` or encryption key securely while letting automation run.

---

### 13. Ansible Operators
**Puzzle**: “When container orchestration demands day-2 ops logic, which Ansible feature suits CRD-based automation in Kubernetes?”  
**Hint**: A feature bridging Ansible logic and Operator pattern.

---

### 14. Dynamic Inventories in Ansible
**Puzzle**: “Resources shift as ephemeral fleets appear—how do you automatically discover these hosts for your plays?”  
**Hint**: Scripts or plugins that fetch host data from clouds or external APIs on the fly.

---

### 15. Combining All: Terraform + Vault + Packer + Ansible
**Puzzle**: “To conjure an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for ephemeral infrastructure, you harness all four magics. Which blueprint do ye name for a synergy that can spin up and tear down entire fleets at will?”  
**Hint**: The advanced pattern that wraps image building, secrets retrieval, config management, and provisioning in a single pipeline.
