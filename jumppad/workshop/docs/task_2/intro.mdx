## HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault Dedicated
For this lab, we are leveraging a single shared HCP Vault Dedicated with child namespaces precreated and configured for each team.

## Get AppRole credentials for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)
AAP natively uses Vault's AppRole Authenication method. The first step would be to receive these credentials so you can configure AAP to interact with Vault.

### Retrieve AAP AppRole Credentials

vault read -namespace=admin/testorgc auth/approle/role/aap/role-id
vault write -namespace=admin/testorgc -force auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
