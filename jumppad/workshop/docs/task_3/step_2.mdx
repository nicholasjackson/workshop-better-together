# üíª Step 2: Update Existing Terraform to Deploy New Secure Packer Image with AAP provider

With the Minecraft server image built, it's time to deploy it using Terraform. But beware‚Äîthe final gateway to the treasure remains locked. Only by configuring Terraform to integrate with Ansible can you prove your worth and gain access!

# 1. Essential Details for Deployment
Before making any changes, take note of the essential machine details and AAP credentials:
## Machine Name
```
{{ machine_url }}
```
## Ansible Automation Platform
```bash
https://44.210.128.100
```
Go to the Ansible Automation Platform tab and login with your credential:
```bash
username: <team_name>_admin
Ansible Automation password:{{ ansible_pass }}
```
# 2. Update existing Terraform Configuration
In this step, you will update your Terraform setup to deploy the new secure Minecraft image you built with Packer.

You will also integrate Terraform with AAP using the AAP provider to automatically update the Minecraft server access list upon deployment.

The AAP provider allows application teams to directly manage their application inventory and can co-exist with dynamic inventories that may be managed using cloud metadata.
We use the Ansible Automation Platform **ansible/aap** provider to perform the following tasks: 

* Create an inventory in your AAP organization.
* Create a host in the inventory and assign the ansible_host and ansible_port.
* Execute an existing job template to whitelist your Minecraft usernames, granting your team access to the server.

_See the sample code snippet below (for Reference Only)_:
```hcl
# Create a new AAP inventory for the your minecraft server
resource "aap_inventory" "dedicated_minecraft" {
  name = "minecraft_dedicated"
  description = "Dedicated Minecraft Server"
  organization = local.org_id
}

# Create a new AAP host for the minecraft server
resource "aap_host" "vm_hosts" {
  inventory_id = aap_inventory.dedicated_minecraft.id
  name         = var.minecraft_hostname  # Use the hostname for each VM
  variables    = jsonencode({
    "ansible_host"     : "${var.minecraft_hostname}",
    "ansible_port"     : var.ansible_port
})
}

resource "aap_job" "minecraft_whitelist" {
  job_template_id = local.template_id
  inventory_id    = aap_inventory.dedicated_minecraft.id
  extra_vars      = jsonencode({
    "minecraft_usernames" : var.minecraft_usernames
  })

  triggers = {
    "${var.minecraft_hostname}" : "${var.trigger_run}"
  }
  
}
```

1. Before proceeding ensure your in the terraform directory from the terminal.
Switch to the terraform directory and copy the files from the aap directory to Terraform directory.
See below:
```bash
cd /workshop/src/working/terraform
cp ../aap/* .
```
2. Confirm the files are copied by listing  the contents of the directory: 
```bash
root@debian:/workshop/src/working/terraform# ls
```
_You should see these files in the terraform directory as `aap.tf`,  `main.tf`, `providers.tf`, and  `terraform.auto.tfvars`_.

</Task>

3. Update the `terraform.auto.tfvars` using the terminal and `vi`, or if you are more comfortable with the vscode you can use that from the workshop tab.

_Alternatively you can follow the steps below to use the CLI_.

```bash
vi terraform.auto.tfvars
```

```bash
# terraform.auto.tfvars
aap_username="<team_name>_admin" replace <team_name> with your team name
aap_password="" # AAP password {{ ansible_pass }} see the docs at the top of the task page
minecraft_hostname="" # your minecraft hostname is {{ machine_url }}
minecraft_usernames=[] # update with your minecraft usernames in > ["user1","user2"]
image_source="/var/workshop/images/minecraft_vm_ansible/minecraft-vm-ansible.qcow2"
```
4. Save the updates:

```bash
esc :wq
```
## üîç Did You Get It Right?

<Task id="terraform_validate">
validate the terraform configuration updates
</Task>
```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

5. Once you have validated the terraform configuration, 
you can run terraform plan to review the changes.

```bash
terraform plan
```

6. Deploy Terraform Configuration:
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
_see example run below_: 
```bash
aap_inventory.dedicated_minecraft: Creating...
aap_inventory.dedicated_minecraft: Creation complete after 1s [name=minecraft_dedicated]
aap_host.vm_hosts: Creating...
aap_job.minecraft_whitelist: Creating...
aap_job.minecraft_whitelist: Creation complete after 0s
aap_host.vm_hosts: Creation complete after 0s [name=debian.32xyd90e36sn.instruqt.io]
libvirt_volume.ubuntu-qcow2: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
libvirt_volume.ubuntu-qcow2: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
libvirt_volume.ubuntu-qcow2: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
libvirt_volume.ubuntu-qcow2: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
libvirt_volume.ubuntu-qcow2: Creation complete after 50s [id=/var/workshop/pools/ubuntu/ubuntu-qcow2]

Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```
7. Now that your Minecraft server is up and running, test your deployment by verifying your team can successfully connect and access the server.

8. Launch Minecraft and connect to your deployed server. You can use the same multiplayer settings as before.

**If all has been configured correctly you will be able to access the server and you
should see Pirate `HashiCorp_Nic` in the game**.
