# üíª Step 3: Configure a User for Your Minecraft User


You will use the username of your Minecraft user as the userpass user and the Minecraft UUID as the password.

1. To retrieve UUID: go to this link as below<Link href="https://mcuuid.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"/>

2. Enter your Minecraft user and click the `Lookup` button. 

_You should see something like this_:

3. Copy the `Full UUID` value and use it as the password for the user. Export env vars as below:

```bash
export MINECRAFT_USER=<your minecraft user>
export MCUUID=<full mcuuid>
```

4. Create a Vault user for your Minecraft username using the `userpass` authentication method, and attach the tavern policy to grant access to the `tavern_key` secret:

```bash
vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} /auth/userpass/users/${MINECRAFT_USER} password="${MCUUID}" policies="tavern"
```

_You should see the output as the following_:

```bash
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/<minecraft user>
```

_Feel free to use the Vault UI to verify the user has been created as expected_.

**Now that is done, let's create a policy for the user in the next step.**

## üîç Did You Get It Right?

<Solution title="Solution">
Check your environment vars are set correctly and the policy has been attached.

```bash
echo $TEAM_NAME
echo $MINECRAFT_USER
vault read -ns admin/${TEAM_NAME} auth/userpass/users/${MINECRAFT_USER}
```

```bash
Key                        Value
---                        -----
token_bound_cidrs          []
token_explicit_max_ttl     0s
token_max_ttl              0s
token_no_default_policy    false
token_num_uses             0
token_period               0s
token_policies             [tavern]
token_ttl                  0s
token_type                 default
```
</Solution>
