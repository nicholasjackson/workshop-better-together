# üíª Step 1: Retreive AppRole Credentials and Configure AAP
In this step, you will retreive the AppRole credentials and configure AAP to use Vault's SSH key signing for Ansible's job execution.

The AppRole auth method has been preconfigured for each team in their respective namespaces, as such the Role ID and Secret ID are unique to each team and are stored in Vault. This task will guide you through retrieving the Role ID and Secret ID for use with AAP. 

With the door now open, you step inside the dimly lit chamber. The air is thick with mystery, and on the far wall, a mechanical lockbox gleams under the flickering lantern light. Inscribed on its surface are strange markings‚Äîan ancient security mechanism known as AppRole Authentication. To proceed, you must extract the Role ID and Secret ID from Vault, using them to power up the automation magic of AAP.

## 1. Retreive AppRole Credentials

1. Using the same terminal session from the previous tasks, retrieve the Role ID with the following command, assuming TEAM_NAME is already set:

```bash
vault read -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} <role_id from Blackbeards treasure chest>
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
Key        Value
---        -----
role_id    3d05b15f-4262-419a-c609-b3a2633877b4
```

2. Retreive the Secret ID using the command as below:

```bash
vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} -f <secret_id from Blackbeards treasure chest>
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
# vault write -ns=admin/testorga -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
Key                   Value
---                   -----
secret_id             950d8a35-5b34-228f-5475-030c6ecbf970
secret_id_accessor    7978c558-2d0c-5ab9-c178-89ee68bab69c
secret_id_num_uses    0
secret_id_ttl         0s
```

3. Copy the `role_id` and `secret_id` as you will need them in the next task.

echo $TEAM_NAME

vault write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} -f auth/approle/role/aap/secret-id
```
</Solution>

## 2. Configure AAP Vault SSH Credentials

1. From the Instruqt lab, click on the **Ansible Automation Platform** tab to open the AAP interface. Ignore any certificate warnings as this is a lab environment.
2. Enter your team‚Äôs assigned username and retrieve the password from Vault‚Äôs KVv2 Secrets Engine at the path `secrets/app`. See the previous step for details on accessing Vault.

```bash
AAP_Username:`<team_name>_admin`  
AAP_Password:`{{ ansible_pass }}`
```

3. From the left menu, click Automation Execution, then Infrastructure, and select Credentials. Locate the hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle credential, which has been preconfigured, but you will need to enter your AppRole Role ID and Secret ID to complete the setup.

4. Edit the credentials for the **hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle** credential.
5. Enter the Role ID and Secret ID you retrieved in the previous task into the respective fields.

6. Click **Save credential** to save the configuration.

See TA if your stuck and need help. 
You will be unable to complete the next task without the AppRole credentials.
