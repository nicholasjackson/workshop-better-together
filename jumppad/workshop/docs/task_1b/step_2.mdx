# 💻 Step 2: Create a Vault policy to allow access to the tavern_key

Each team has a unique namespace in Vault, this is rooted under the `admin` namespace.
For example if your team name is `team1`, your namespace will be `admin/team1`.

Within your namespace `userpass` authentication method is enabled. This allows you to create users and assign policies to them.
In order to open the iron door, you need to create a user for your Minecraft user and ensure that the user has the correct policy 
attached granting access to the `tavern_key` secret engine and open the iron door.



1. Create a policy that allows access to the `tavern_key` in the kv2 secret engine
for your namespace using the following command:

```bash
vault policy write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} tavern - <<EOF
path "secrets/data/tavern_key" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
Success! Uploaded policy: tavern
```

**Now that the policy is created, let's create a user and assign them this policy.**
