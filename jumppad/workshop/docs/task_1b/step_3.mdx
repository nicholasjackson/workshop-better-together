# 💻 Step 3: Create a Vault policy to allow access to the tavern_key

The user you just added to the `userpass` authentication method will alow your Minecraft
user to authenticate to Vault. But, in order to access the `tavern_key` secret you will need to 
create a policy and attach it to the user.

1. Create a policy called `tavern` that allows access to the `tavern_key`.

_The `tavern_key` secret is in the Vault kv2 secret engine at the path `secrets/data/tavern_key`_.

_A policy that would allow read access to this secret would look like the following_:

```javascript
path "secrets/data/tavern_key" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

2. Add this policy to Vault using the following command:

```bash
vault policy write -ns=admin/${TEAM_NAME} tavern - <<EOF
path "secrets/data/tavern_key" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

_You should see the following output_:

```bash
Success! Uploaded policy: tavern
```

Now that the policy is created, you can attach it to the user in the next step.
