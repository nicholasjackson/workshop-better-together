# Step 3: Configure AAP Machine credentials

In this step, you will update the machine credentials in AAP to use Vault's Signed SSH credential configured in the previous step.

Machine credentials are associated with Ansible's Job templates and allow for authenticated access to a target machine and execution of a Ansible playbook.

AAP will request Vault's SSH Secrets Engine to sign the provided public key. The underlyning machine has already been configured to trust Vault's SSH Secrets Engine public key.

## Configure AAP Machine credentials
<Task id="configure_aap_machine_creds">
1. From the left menu, click on **Automation Execution** and then **Credentials**. The `minecraft_ssh_credentials` has been preconfigured but you'll need to input your SSK keypair.

2. Edit the machine credentials for **minecraft_ssh_credentials**.

3. Copy the `ssh-unsigned-private-key` you retrieved in the previous task into the **SSH Private Key** field.

4. Click the **Signed SSH Certificate** key icon to open the **Select external credential** configuration window.
    ![Select external credential](/assets/task_2/aap_machine_creds_ssh.png)
    * From the *Credential* dropdown list, select **hashicorp_vault_ssh_approle**. 
    * For `Unsigned Public Key`, insert a unsigned public key. You can use the `ssh-unsigned-public-key` key provided in the `secrets/aap` path in Vault or use your own if you are feeling adventurous.
    * For `Path to Secret`, insert `ssh`.
    * For `Path to Auth`, insert `approle`.
    * For `Role Name`, insert `aap`.
5. Click **Test**

6. If the test is successful, click **Finish** and **Save credential** to save the configuration.

<Solution title="Solution: Retrieving SSH keypair from Vault">
The SSH keypair was generated using Terraform and stored in Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine.

1. Login to Vault if you haven't already, see step 1 for instructions.
2. Retreive the SSH keypairs from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, replace `<your_team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault kv get -namespace=admin/<your_team_name> secrets/aap
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault kv get -namespace=admin/testorga secrets/aap
== Secret Path ==
secrets/data/aap
