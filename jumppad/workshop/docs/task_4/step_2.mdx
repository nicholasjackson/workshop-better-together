## Scenario

## Puzzle Format & Difficulty Levels

    - Short questions or riddles, often referencing basics of Terraform, Vault KV secrets, or simple Packer config.
    - Rewards: Low-value items (e.g., compasses = 5 gold coins).
- Intermediate (15 puzzles)
    - More in-depth tasks, like retrieving secrets using Vault AppRole or referencing advanced Ansible playbook steps.
    - Rewards: Medium-value items (e.g., iron ingots = 10 gold coins).
- Difficult (15 puzzles)
    - Complex, scenario-based challenges (e.g., multi-cloud Terraform, advanced Packer provisioners, layered Vault PKI usage, or tricky Ansible roles).
    - Rewards: High-value items (e.g., gold ingots = 20 coins, diamonds = 25 coins).

## How to Engage the Puzzles

1. Puzzle Board at Spawn

* Choose any difficulty tier (Easy, Intermediate, Difficult).
* Collect the puzzle instructions (could be a sign, an in-game book, or a web link in Instruqt).

2. Solve the Puzzle

## Time & Strategy
