# Step 1: Login to HCP Vault to retrieve your team’s secret


1.  Open the Instruqt terminal and set the Vault environment variable:
```
export VAULT_ADDR=https://skoaap-public-vault-8683511a.d19fbab7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200
```
_For this lab,  the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster is accessible over the public internet. Generally, this is not recommended and should be disabled. If there is a requirement to allow public access, we recommend customers to use the IP allow list as measure to limit access and security exposure. More information can be found in the [Manage public network access
](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/manage-public-access)_.
2.  Verify Vault is running:
```
vault status
```
_You should see the following output_
```
root@debian:/workshop/src/working# vault status
Key                      Value

```
3. Login using the `userpass` method with the team's credentials by using the command. 
```
vault login -namespace=admin -method=userpass username=#your_team_name# password='<password>'
```
_Replace `#your_team_name#` and `<password>` with your team's credentials_.

_You should see the following output_
```
vault login -namespace=admin -method=userpass username=testorga
Password (will be hidden): 
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

Key                    Value
---                    -----
token                  REDACTED

identity_policies      []
policies               ["default" "testorga"]
token_meta_username    testorga
```
4. Read the riddle posted on the tavern wall:
```
I hold the whispers of the wind and the stories of the sea. To enter my chamber, seek the city of sin and the state of silver.
```
5. Find the Vault secret key using:
```
vault kv get -namespace=admin/#your_team_name# secrets/skofy26
```
_Replace `#your_team_name#` with your team's name_.

_You should see the following output_
```
root@debian:/workshop/src/working# vault kv get -namespace=admin/testorga secrets/skofy26
==== Secret Path ====
secrets/data/skofy26

Key                Value

```
6. Look at the output and find the city and state.
7. Use the retrieved secret as the password to unlock the door in Minecraft.

_🚪 If correct, the door will open_!

## To CUT--Retrieve KV secrets

<Task id="read_kv_secrets">
1. Using the same terminal that you logged into Vault with, retreive a secret from Vault's KVv2 Secrets Engine by using the command, replace `<team_name>` with your team's name.
```bash
vault kv get -ns=admin/<team_name> secrets/skofy26
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
# vault kv get -ns=admin/testorga secrets/skofy26
