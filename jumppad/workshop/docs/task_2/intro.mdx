# Introduction

## ðŸšª Beyond The Locked Door â€“ Vault Secrets

## ðŸ§­ Learning Objectives:
By completing this task, you will:

* âœ… Use Vault-signed SSH credentials to configure access for AAP.
* âœ… Solve in-game puzzles to unlock the hidden door inside the tavern.
* âœ… Locate and open the treasure chest to retrieve the book of secrets for Task 3.

## ðŸ“– Scenario:

You have retrieved the next clue from Blackbeards treasure chest, it contains vital infomation
that will help you to your next step in your journey.

## Under the Hood 

1. Configure Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Hashicorp Vault Signed SSH credentials plugin to authenticate with Hashicorp Vault
2. Configure machine credentials for Ansible Job Templates to authenticate with remote hosts using Vault signed SSH credentials
3. Each team will be allocated a team name that will present as a child namespace in Vault and organization in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).
4. For this lab, we are leveraging a single shared HCP Vault Dedicated. The parent namespace `admin` is configured with `userpass` authentication method for each team to authenticate with their respective child namespaces to read KV secrets and retreive AppRole credentials.
5. AAP itself will be configured to authenticate with Vault using the AppRole method directly to the child namespaces.
